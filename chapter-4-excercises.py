# P-4.23 Implement a recursive function with signature find(path, filename) that reports all entries of the file system rooted at the given path having the given file name.
# Tip: Review use of the os module.

# P-4.24 Write a program for solving summation puzzles by enumerating and testing all possible configurations.
# Using your program, solve the three puzzles given in Section 4.4.3.
# Tip: Use recursion in your main solution engine.

# P-4.25 Provide a nonrecursive implementation of the draw interval function for the English ruler project of Section 4.1.2.
# There should be precisely 2^c−1 lines of output if c represents the length of the center tick.
# If incrementing a counter from 0 to 2^c−2, the number of dashes for each tick line should be exactly one more than the number of consecutive 1’s at the end of the binary representation of the counter.
# Tip: Consider a small example to see why the binary representation of the counter is relevant.

# P-4.26 Write a program that can solve instances of the Tower of Hanoi problem (from Exercise C-4.14).
# Tip: Note the recursive nature of the problem.

# P-4.27 Python's os module provides a function with signature walk(path) that is a generator yielding the tuple (dirpath, dirnames, filenames) for each subdirectory of the directory identified by string path, such that string dirpath is the full path to the subdirectory, dirnames is a list of the names of the subdirectories within dirpath, and filenames is a list of the names of non-directory entries of dirpath.
# For example, when visiting the cs016 subdirectory of the file system shown in Figure 4.6, the walk would yield ('/user/rt/courses/cs016', ['homeworks', 'programs'], ['grades']) Give your own implementation of such a walk function.
# Tip: Review use of the other methods of the os module.
